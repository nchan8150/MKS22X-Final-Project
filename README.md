## Development Log
### Before the Demo
- A grid-like board, each grid-tile capable of holding one turret. Enemies traverse the edges of tiles, turning at intersections.
- 4 different turrets with unique costs, stats, abilities, and colors.
- Waves of enemies that increase in difficulty as the game progresses.
- Enemies that have hp represented by size of character model.
- A base with a life counter that changes color based on health remaining.
- Score counter.
- Currency tracker.
- Ability to select and place towers with both arrow keys and mouseclick.
- Ability to sell towers at a 90% return rate.
- Ability to pause the game.
- Ability to restart the game.
- Ability to manually advance waves of enemies.

### After the Demo
- A leaderboard that saves your top 3 scores. When you beat an old highscore, it is replaced. If you don't beat one, no input available.
- Upgrades that increase power and decrease reload time for towers, at a hefty price.
